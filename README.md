Created by matthewjearly@gmail.com under appropriate licenses and laws. My license and law guess: Open Source for the programming libraries, Fair Use for the Ark data, and Creative Commons for the Program Icon and Algos I created. I am not 100% on these and am more concerned with making a solid program.

## About
This is a lightweight program to check out how much pwn your weapons do in ARK. I am not affiliated with WildCard Studios - I'm doing this **for fun and education** as a wiki type assistant.  All the weapon damage data used here is from [ARK Survival Evolved gamepedia wiki](http://ark.gamepedia.com/ARK_Survival_Evolved_Wiki) and the algo's, program icon, and program structure are my own.

#### How to use?
1. Download and Unzip the 'ARK Damage Calc vXXXX-win32.zip' file.  Save it in your desired location.
2. Run the 'ARK-Survial-Evolved-damage-calculator.exe' application to start the program.  
	* You may need to okay it through your Windows security prompts. 
	* This main '.exe' file must stay in the folder with the .dll's and other folders.  You can make shortcuts to it or pin it to your start menu. 
3. Once running: use the weapon drop-down to select your weapon, change the percent, then click Calculate! (or press Enter). Additionally you can click the weapon picture on the left to visit the wiki page about this weapon.
